Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the topmost row contains the number 1, and each row after that begins and ends with the number 1, and every other number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The pattern of numbers in Pascal's triangle is related to the binomial coefficients, which are used in probability theory and algebra.

Here is an example of a Pascal's triangle with five rows:

    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

Each number in a row of Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. For example, the number 4 in the fifth row is the sum of the number 3 in the fourth row and the number 1 in the fourth row.

Pascal's triangle has many interesting properties and has many uses in mathematics, such as in probability theory, algebra, and combinatorics.
